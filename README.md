# LoanRepaymentForecast

4/12/19 - This applicaiton is created from a modified two-part tutorial. Part one is adding a MySQL database to NetBeans. Part two 
is creating a simple Java web applicaiton to provide a user interface for displaying information from the database. I plan to add
create, update, and delete functionality to allow for manual data entry.

Furture plans - add back in the read from text file feature from the first applicaiton project. Add in ability to read CSV files.
